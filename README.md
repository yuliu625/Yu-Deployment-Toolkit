# Deployment Toolkit

## Overview
This is a collection of lightweight automation scripts designed to eliminate the friction of repetitive environment setup.

Born out of a desire to move away from "manual rebuilding," this repository aims to achieve **rapid development environment initialization** and **unified configuration** across multiple platforms through scripted operations.


## Contents
The scripts are organized by platform to ensure seamless deployment across different environments:

| Platform | Script Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ubuntu** | Shell Scripts | Environment initialization, common tool installation, and application deployment for Linux servers. |
| **Windows** | PowerShell | Focused on dev-machine setup, package management, and resolving Windows-specific compatibility issues. |
| **Termux** | Shell Scripts | Optimized for Android/Termux; ideal for lightweight mobile dev, SSH tunneling, and mobile Linux environments. |


## Roadmap
This repository evolves alongside my daily workflow and the new challenges I encounter:

- [ ] **Continuous Collection**: Regularly organizing and optimizing new deployment and configuration scripts.
- [ ] **Platform Expansion**: Future support for **macOS** automation.
- [ ] **Containerization**: Migrating specific build workflows to **Docker** images.
